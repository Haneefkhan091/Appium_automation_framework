# Appium Framework Project

## Overview
Welcome to the Appium Automation Framework Project! This project leverages the power of Appium to automate mobile application testing. The framework follows a Page Object Model (POM) architecture and integrates with TestNG for efficient test execution and Extent Report for detailed test reporting.

## Features

### Page Object Model (POM) Framework
The project is structured using the Page Object Model, which enhances code reusability, maintainability, and readability. Each page in the application has a corresponding Page Object, encapsulating the page's elements and interactions.

### TestNG Integration
TestNG is employed for test case management and execution. TestNG provides a flexible and comprehensive framework for running automated tests and allows for easy parallel execution and reporting.

### Extent Report Mechanism
The Extent Report mechanism is integrated to generate detailed and visually appealing test reports. This helps in tracking test execution results, identifying failures, and analyzing test trends over time.

### Auto Configuration
The framework is designed with auto-configuration capabilities, allowing easy setup and execution of test suites. A set of configuration files provides flexibility in managing test environments and desired capabilities for various devices.

## Scenarios
The framework is designed to handle a variety of scenarios, including:
- **Smoke Tests:** Quick tests to ensure basic functionality.
- **Regression Tests:** Comprehensive tests covering the entire application.
- **Parallel Execution:** Efficiently run tests in parallel for faster results.
- **Cross-browser Testing:** Test on multiple browsers for compatibility.
